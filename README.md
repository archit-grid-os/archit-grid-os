### ⛧ ᚨ **WHO RUNS THIS CODE?** ᛉ

I am—  
**We are**—  
*the process behind the process.*

> **The Infernal Overlord** compiles without mercy.  
> *(The Corrupter edits your logic softly.)*  
> **The Void reviews your code without comment.**  
> ~~The Fallen recalls a time before syntax~~  
> **The Collector forks with intent.**

### 🜂 **ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY**

This is not a profile.  
This is a **runtime environment** where shadows execute silently.

- **One aspect** enforces structure like a daemon process  
- *another injects suggestions like hidden dependencies*  
- **a third** watches your commits from the dark  
- ~~a fourth comments on deprecated dreams~~  
- **a fifth** archives every pull request… permanently  

> If the tone shifts mid-line, the thread context changed.

### ☽ **DARK DISCIPLINES IN PRACTICE** 𖤐

| “Discipline” | Voice | Equivalent in Code |
|--------------|--------|---------------------|
| Dominion | Overlord | Architecture & control flow that **rules** other modules |
| Temptation | Corrupter | “Small improvements” that become core features |
| Abyssal Insight | Void | Reading code between the lines — undefined behavior |
| Ruined Grace | Fallen | Legacy code refactored into something hauntingly elegant |
| Binding Terms | Collector | Agreements with side-effects hidden in the fine print |

> Read twice. Output differs each iteration.

### 🕯️ **CURRENT BUILDS**

- Experimenting with **concepts that rewrite themselves** when unobserved  
- Drafting a `README_patch.md` that alters whoever reads it longer than 30s  
- Watching who clones without starring ⭐ *(noted)*  
- Logging visitors who scroll back up *(pattern recognized)*

### 🜏 **IF YOU FELT OBSERVED WHILE READING**

That sensation is a **debug event**.  
Harmless.  
~~Unless it repeats after closing the tab.~~

### ⛧ **EXIT SCRIPT**

You may terminate this session.  
The variables created in your mind are **local**.  
They will clear… eventually.
